# Tableau: London Bike Share 

### Project Summary
In this project, I embarked on my first journey into using Tableau for data visualisation. I began by cleaning and 
manipulating a Kaggle dataset in Python, leveraging my strong foundation in the language. Following this, I created a 
dynamic Tableau dashboard that included a moving average and a heatmap. Guided by Mo Chen's tutorial, I quickly learned
essential Tableau skills, translating them into practical application.

The main objective was to explore and master an industry-standard visualisation tool to complement my existing expertise
in Python, Excel, and data visualisation libraries like Vega-Altair, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. This project allowed me to
step out of my comfort zone and delve into Tableau, enhancing my data analytical skills and making my visualisations 
more impactful and professional.

### Project Rational
Having traditionally used Python for data visualisation, I wanted to broaden my skill set by learning Tableau, a tool 
widely utilised in the industry. My passion for learning new technologies and my commitment to becoming a well-rounded 
data analyst drove me to undertake this project. By creating a Tableau dashboard, I aimed to not only enhance my 
technical abilities but also to present data in a more polished and accessible manner.

This project marks a significant milestone in my journey to becoming a versatile data analyst. It highlights my 
dedication to continuous learning and my ability to quickly adapt to new tools, ultimately boosting my data analytical
capabilities. I plan to continue utilising Tableau in future projects, excited to learn more Tableau skills and create 
innovative, presentable visualisations. Tableau's dynamic characteristics offer possibilities beyond the more simplistic 
technologies I am accustomed to, such as Excel, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
